Array ? 
What is this ? 

Array is a reference data type stored in memory of the EVm [ Ethereum Virtual Machine ]

In an array a single type of data type can eb stored, so for instance you can onyl store only strings, only uint, or only address.

This is an example of a fixed size array. 
Remember in Solidity we are having two types of array, fixed and dynamic. 

With the use of this code, we can find a number/element which is inside the array.
